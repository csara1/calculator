The following keyboard keys are captured and used by the calculator:
- "Esc" (like red button "C") to clear the calculation
- "Backspace" (like orange button "<") to delete the last digit or decimal point entered (button stays gray while disabled)
- "+", "-", "*" and "/" (like the yellow buttons with the same operator) to select a math operation (button stays green while selected)
- the number keys (like the white buttons with the same digit) to enter an operand (buttons stay gray while disabled)
- "." (like the white button with the same symbol) to enter a decimal point (button stays gray while disabled)
- "Enter" and "=" (like blue button "=") to perform the calculation

The remaining keyboard keys are allowed to propagate to the browser.
